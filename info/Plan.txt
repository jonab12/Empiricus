TASKS [ TO BE OPENED ALONG ECLIPSE ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document is responsible for what I intend to do in the program.

First comes first. I need to understand how the game works before jumping into something complicated like AIs
No really understand the code line by line. It may take a week and you may need to look at every variable but once
you get it it will be better.

It is essential that you do not rip off code as you will understand less...

GAME PLAN
---------

What I hope to accomplish for this game is to make a RTS [real time stragety game] called Empiricus where your primary
objective is to defend the command center from enemies. They will spawn from across the bridge and come to your center.
You will have to spawn units from the center to combat them using points gathered from fallen enemies.

! One thing you have to keep in mind is that moving the camera of the map to look at enemies/freindlies will be somewhat
of a pain. However your character is your camera to the map so if you remove him ~. Now this is a tough project and AIs will
be a pain. Try to learn the most you can.

This is basically it. If this goes sucessful then you can move on to optimizing the game and find a way to 
gain points from a center 'economy'.  




PRIORITY TASKS
--------------

1. GUN (NOT COMPLETED - 00/00/0000)

@ Need to add a sprite image of gun in lower screen counting bullets
@ Ever-time a shot is fired bullets--
@ When x shots have been fired need to make thread sleep or wait x seconds until gun is 'reloaded'
- Need to add collision for bullets


2.  ENEMY ENTITY [PART 1/3] (NOT COMPLETED - 00/00/0000)

- Need to add a enemy sprite onto screen on a certain coordinate.
- Need to devise a way how if the bullet reaches his coordinates the enemy disapears
- Maybe after this find a way how the enemy has 'health'. It takes x hits to kill him


3. ENEMY ENTITY MOVING [PART 2/3] (NOT COMPLETED - 00/00/0000)
- Make the enemy move from one coordinate to another


3. ENEMY ENTITY PATH-FINDING [PART 3/3] (NOT COMPLETED - 00/00/0000)
- Make the enemy move to your coordinates (e.g. zombie). This will be very hard
as your coordinates is always shifting.



OPTIONAL TASKS
--------------

1. MUSIC/SOUND EFFECTS- add sound effects along bullets, make a class that stores sound files and make them accessible where needed.
